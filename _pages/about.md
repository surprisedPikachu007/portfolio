I am a final year undergraduate student at [Dr. N.G.P. Institute of Technology](https://www.drngpit.ac.in/), Coimbatore, India. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python and C. I have also delved into various web development frameworks and tools, including React and Django.

I am currently working on my project title "Search Engine Summarizer". The project aims to provide a summary of the search engine results for a given query. The project is being developed using FastAPI, a python framework for building APIs as a backend and React as a frontend.
